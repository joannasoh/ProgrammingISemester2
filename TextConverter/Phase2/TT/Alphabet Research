You want a native python dictionary.

(and you probably also want your values to start from"0" not from "1" , so you can void adding a +1 on all your mappings, as bellow)

Build one with this:

*import string
values = dict()
for index, letter in enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase):
   values[letter] = index + 1*
This will give you things like:

*print values["a"]
-> 1*
Of course, you probably could use the "ord" built-in function and skip this dictionary altogether, as in the other answers:

*print ord("c") - (ord("a")) + 1*
Or in python 3.x or 2.7, you can create the dicionary in a single pass with a dict generator expression:

*values = {chr(i): i + 1 for i in range(ord("a"), ord("a") + 26)}*
