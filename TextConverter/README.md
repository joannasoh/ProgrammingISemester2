# Text Encryption Proposal

This program will convert your words into an encrypted alphabet that consists of symbols. The user will be able to choose from 3 different alphabets. Once text has been inputed, it will then give you the converted text for the desired symbol alphabet. The converted text will be able to be copied and used to the user's will.
